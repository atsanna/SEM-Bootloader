 Flashing bootloader:
 --------------------
-During development an [ArduinoISP](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP "ArduinoISP")
-was used to burn the bootloader on the board and that is what is supported in
-the default Makefile. If you have another ISP and since you are here it is safe
-assume that you know how to edit the Makefile to support your ISP. After
-connecting your ISP all you need to do is "make install" in the firmware
-directory.
-
-The size of the bootloader is currently 2375 bytes without any debug messages.
+During development an AVR-ISP-MK2 from Olimex was used to burn the bootloader.
+The original code was developed using an [ArduinoISP](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP "ArduinoISP").
+Both are supported in the default Makefile. If you have another ISP and since 
+you are here it is safe assume that you know how to edit the Makefile to support 
+your ISP. After connecting your ISP all you need to do is "make install" in the 
+firmware directory.
+
+The size of the bootloader is about 2500 bytes without any debug messages.
 With full debugging enabled it is well over 4k so you can't enable all messages
 at the same time.
 
 
 Configuring your network:
 -------------------------
-The bootloader's' default address is 192.168.1.250. Configure your computer
-network card to a static address of 192.168.1.1 with a subnet of 255.255.255.0.
+The bootloader's' default address is 192.168.84.128. Configure your computer
+network card to a static address of 192.168.84.x with a subnet of 255.255.255.0.
 By default, the bootloader assumes an internet gateway is at address
-192.168.1.1. The default network settings can be changed at the top of the
+192.168.84.1. The default network settings can be changed at the top of the
 "net.h" file.
 
 The bootloader listens to port 69 for incoming connections and switches to
